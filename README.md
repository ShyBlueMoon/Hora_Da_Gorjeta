Project: Hora da Gorjeta App (Tip Time App)
==================================


Introduction
------------

This is a project to demonstrate the concepts I learned on Android development.
It's an app to calculate the tip value (15, 18 or 20%) on top of a service with the possibility to round up the amount.

Concepts such as user inputs, themes, styles, icons, instrumented tests and a splash screen were practiced and implemented in this app.
